# Security Checklist for StayFinder

## üîí Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP) with environment-specific rules
- [x] CORS configuration with origin validation
- [x] Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [x] JWT token authentication
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Input validation with express-validator
- [x] MongoDB injection prevention
- [x] Rate limiting configuration ready

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- [ ] Remove 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' from production CSP
- [ ] Implement nonce-based CSP for production
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Set up CSP violation reporting
- [ ] Configure HTTPS in production
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring

### üî¥ Critical for Production
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Secrets management (JWT_SECRET, API keys)
- [ ] Database connection security (SSL/TLS)
- [ ] Error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Security testing and penetration testing

## üìã Pre-Production Security Checklist

### 1. CSP Hardening
```bash
# Test CSP with browser developer tools
# Ensure no 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-eval' in production
# Implement nonce-based script execution
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Verify all environment variables are set
# Use strong, unique JWT_SECRET
# Configure production database with authentication
# Set NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. HTTPS Configuration
```bash
# Configure SSL/TLS certificates
# Enable HSTS headers
# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
# Update CORS origins to HTTPS
```

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
```bash
# Set up error logging (Winston, etc.)
# Configure CSP violation reporting
# Implement security event monitoring
# Set up uptime monitoring
```

### 5. Dependencies & Updates
```bash
# Run npm audit and fix vulnerabilities
# Keep dependencies updated
# Use npm ci in production
# Implement dependency scanning
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong JWT secrets (256-bit minimum)
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add role-based access control
- Consider implementing 2FA for hosts

### Data Protection
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries (Mongoose handles this)
- Implement data encryption for sensitive fields
- Regular database backups with encryption

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting per endpoint
- Add request size limits
- Use API versioning
- Implement proper error handling

### Infrastructure Security
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Network security (firewalls, VPNs)

## üîß Quick Security Fixes

### Immediate (Development)
1. Restrict CSP to specific domains
2. Remove server information headers
3. Add input validation to all endpoints
4. Implement proper error handling

### Short-term (Pre-Production)
1. Implement nonce-based CSP
2. Add rate limiting middleware
3. Set up HTTPS with proper certificates
4. Configure production database security

### Long-term (Production)
1. Security audit and penetration testing
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring
3. Regular security updates and patches
4. Incident response procedures
